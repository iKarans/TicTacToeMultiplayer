## Introduction

A multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game designed using python. The socket package is used to run a server on your local IP address. Then users on your local network can connect their clients to the server. If you want users that are outside your WiFi network to connect, then you will need to use your public IP address in the client scripts. You will probably have to open your firewall as well.

The game functions like a your usual Tic-Tac-Toe game. Player one will be a blue circle (I'm lazy) and player two will be the red circle. If there is a winner, a line will be drawn through the winning combination. Either player can use to restart the game by simply pressing the r button.

## Improvements / To Dos

- [ ] Add score count.
- [ ] Winning line doesn't show on the other players client.
- [ ] if a player leaves find a way to save his current moves for when he rejoins
